## 💡 Why Send CI/CD Notifications to Teams?

✅ Instant updates on build and deployment status 🏗️\
✅ Faster troubleshooting of failed builds ❌\
✅ Improved team collaboration 🤝\
✅ Stay informed without logging into CI/CD dashboards 🖥️

## 📌 Setting Up Microsoft Teams Webhook

Before integrating Teams with GitHub or GitLab, we need a webhook to send messages to a specific Teams channel.

🔹 Steps to Create an Incoming Webhook:

1️⃣ Open Microsoft Teams and navigate to your desired channel.\
2️⃣ Click on … (More options) → Manage channel → Connectors.\
3️⃣ Search for "Incoming Webhook" and click Configure.\
4️⃣ Provide a name (e.g., CI/CD Notifications).\
5️⃣ Upload an optional icon for better visibility.\
6️⃣ Click Create, then copy the Webhook URL. Keep it safe! 🔐\

## 🔥 Integrating Teams with GitHub Actions

Let's configure GitHub Actions to send CI/CD notifications to Teams using the webhook we just created! 🏗️

✨ GitHub Actions Workflow Example

Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file with the following:

```yaml
name: Deploy Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build Project
        run: echo "Building the project..." # Replace with actual build steps

      - name: Deploy Project
        run: echo "Deploying..." # Replace with actual deployment steps

      - name: Send CI/CD Status to Teams
        if: always()
        run: |
          curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "text": "**🔹 CI/CD Status Update 🔹**\n
            📌 *Repository:* ${{ github.repository }}\n
            🔄 *Branch:* ${{ github.ref }}\n
            ✅ *Status:* ${{ job.status }}\n
            📎 *Build Log:* [View Here](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})"
          }' "YOUR_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL"
```

# How it works ?

- Triggers on a push to main or manually.
- Runs build and deployment steps.
- Sends a notification to Microsoft Teams, including branch, status, and build logs.
- Runs even if the job fails (if: always()).

## 🔥 Integrating Teams with GitLab CI/CD

If you use GitLab, you can achieve the same functionality by adding a curl request in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` pipeline! 🚀

✨ GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Example

Add the following to .gitlab-ci.yml:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - deploy
  - notify

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building project..." # Replace with actual build steps

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying..." # Replace with actual deployment steps

notify:
  stage: notify
  script:
    - |
      curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "text": "**🔹 CI/CD Status Update 🔹**\n
        📌 *Repository:* $CI_PROJECT_NAME\n
        🔄 *Branch:* $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME\n
        ✅ *Status:* $CI_JOB_STATUS\n
        📎 *Build Log:* [View Here]($CI_JOB_URL)"
      }' "YOUR_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL"
  when: always
```

# 🛠 How It Works

- Uses three stages: build, deploy, and notify.
- The notify stage sends the CI/CD status to Teams.
- Runs even if a job fails (when: always).

## 🎯 Best Practices for CI/CD Notifications

✅ Use different Teams channels for staging and production deployments.\
✅ Include only relevant details (repository, branch, status, logs) to avoid clutter.\
✅ Send failure alerts only to reduce unnecessary noise.\
✅ Secure your webhook URL by storing it in GitHub Secrets or GitLab Variables.\
