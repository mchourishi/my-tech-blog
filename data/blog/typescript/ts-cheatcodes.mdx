TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer experience. This cheatsheet covers essential TypeScript features with examples.

## Annotations

TypeScript allows explicit type annotations to ensure type safety.

```TypeScript
let name: string = 'John';
let age: number = 30;
let numbers:number[] = [1, 2, 3];
```

---

## Tuples

Tuples allow defining arrays with fixed length and types.

```TypeScript
let coordinates: [number, number] = [1, 2];
```

---

## Enums

Enums provide a way to define a set of named constants.

```TypeScript
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
    }
```

---

## Functions

Functions can be annotated with return types and parameter types.

```TypeScript
function greet(name: string): void {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    }
```

---

## Objects

You can specify object structures with specific property types.

```TypeScript
let employee: {name: string, id: number, retire: (date: Date) => void} = {
    name: 'John',
    id : 1
    retire: (date: Date) => {}
}
```

---

## Type Alias

Type aliases allow you to define reusable object shapes.

```TypeScript
type Employee = {
    name: string,
    id: number,
    retire: (date: Date) => void
}
```

---

## Union types

Union types allow variables to hold multiple types.

```TypeScript
let weight: number | string = 50;
weight = '50kg'
```

## Intersection types

Intersection types allow you to combine multiple types into one.

```TypeScript
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    }
    interface Employee {
        name: string;
        id: number;
        }
        let person: Person & Employee = {
            name: 'John',
            age: 30,
            id: 1
            }
```

---

## Literal TypeScript

Literal types are used to define a type that can only be one of a specific set of values.

```TypeScript
type Color = 'red' | 'green' | 'blue';
```

---

## Nullable types

Allow variables to hold null values.

```TypeScript
let name: string | null;
```

---

## Optional Chaining (?.)

Optional chaining prevents errors when accessing properties of null or undefined objects.

```TypeScript
let user = null;
let name = user?.name;
```

---

## Nullish Coalescing (??)

Provides a default value when a variable is null or undefined.

```TypeScript
let user = null;
let name = user ?? 'John';
```

---

## Type Assertion

Type assertions tell TypeScript to treat a variable as a specific type.

```TypeScript
let id = '123' as string;
```

---

## The `unknown` type

The unknown type ensures type safety by requiring explicit type conversions.

```TypeScript
function render(document: unknown){
    // explicit type conversion
    if (typeof document === 'string') {
        console.log(document);
        }
}
```

---

## The `never` type

A function that never returns, often used for infinite loops of errors.

```TypeScript
function neverReturn(): never {
    while (true) {
        // infinite loop
        }
        }
```
