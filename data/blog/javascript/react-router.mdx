## 🟢 Installing React Router 📦

To get started, install React Router:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

---

## 🔵 Setting Up Routes 🛣️

To define routes, wrap your application in the `BrowserRouter` and use the `Routes` and `Route` components.

### Example:

```JSX
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';
import Contact from './Contact';

function App() {
    return (
        <BrowserRouter>
            <Routes>
                <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
                <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
                <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
            </Routes>
        </BrowserRouter>
}

export default App;
```

### 🎯 Key Takeaway:

- The `<Route>` component maps URLs to components.
- The `<Routes>` component ensures only one route is rendered at a time.

## 🔴 Navigating Between Pages 🚪

Instead of using `<a>` tags, React Router provides the `<Link>` component for client-side navigation without refreshing the page.

### Example:

```JSX
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function NavBar() {
    return (
        <nav>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/about">About</Link>
            <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
        </nav>
    );
}
```

✨ Best Practice: Always use `<Link>` instead of `<a>` to prevent full page reloads and enhance performance! 🚀

## 🔴 Programmatic Navigation 🏎️

Sometimes, you need to navigate dynamically (e.g., after form submission). Use the useNavigate hook for this. 🎯

### Example:

```JSX
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
function Login(){
    const navigate = useNavigate();

    function handleSubmit(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        navigate('/dashboard');
        }

    return (<button onClick={handleSubmit}>Login</button>);
}
```

🔥 Why useNavigate?

- Allows dynamic redirection.
- Works inside event handlers.
- Replaces the older useHistory hook.

---

## 🟠 Nested Routes 📁

React Router supports nested routes, making layouts cleaner and more modular.

```JSX
import { Routes, Route, Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';

function DashboardLayout(){
    return (<div>
        <h1>Dashboard</h1>
        <Outlet />
    </div>);
}

function Dashboard(){
    return (
        <Routes>
            <Route path="dashboard" element={<DashboardLayout />} >
            <Route path="settings" element={<h2>Settings</h2>} />
            <Route path="profile" element={<h2>Profile</h2>} />
        </Routes>
        );
}
```

💡 Why use Outlet? It acts as a placeholder for child routes, making layouts reusable and structured. 🏗️

---

## 🔄 Redirects and Not Found Pages ❌

Handle 404 pages and redirects seamlessly with the Navigate component.

### Example:

```JSX
import { Routes, Route, Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function NotFound() {
  return <h2>404 - Page Not Found 😢</h2>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      <Route path="/old-route" element={<Navigate to="/new-route" replace />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}
```

🔍 Key Takeaway:

- The `*` route handles unknown routes (404 pages).
- The `<Navigate>` component redirects users.

---

## 🎯 Wrapping Up

React Router makes navigation in React apps efficient and user-friendly. 🌟

✅ Use `<Routes>` and `<Route>` for defining pages. \
✅ Use `<Link>` instead of `<a>` for smooth transitions. \
✅ Use useNavigate for dynamic navigation. \
✅ Implement nested routes with `<Outlet>`. \
✅ Handle redirects and 404 pages with `<Navigate>`.

By mastering React Router, you ensure your apps are fast, dynamic, and user-friendly! 🚀

Happy Coding! 💻✨
