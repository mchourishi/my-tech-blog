# 🎯 `useMemo` vs `useCallback` in React: When to Use Which?

React's built-in hooks `useMemo` and `useCallback` are powerful tools to optimize performance. But when should you use them? And how do they work? Let's break it down with examples! 🚀

## 🧐 What is `useMemo`?

`useMemo` is a hook that **memoizes a computed value** to avoid unnecessary recalculations.

### ✅ When to use `useMemo`?

- When you have expensive computations.
- When you want to avoid recalculating derived state on every render.
- When you want to cache the result of a function.
- When you want to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

### 📝 Example:

```JSX
import { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComponent({numbers}){
    const sum = useMemo(() => {
        console.log("Calculating sum....");
        return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    }, [numbers]);
}

export default function App(){
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click Me ({count})</button>
        </div>
        );
}
```

**🔍 Without `useMemo`,** the sum would be recalculated on every render, even if `numbers` didn't change!

---

## ⚡ What is `useCallback`?

`useCallback` **memoizes a function reference** to prevent unnecessary re-creations.

### ✅ When to use `useCallback`?

- When passing functions as props to child components.
- When a function should not be re-created unless dependencies change.

### 📝 Example:

```jsx
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react'

function Child({ onClick }) {
  console.log('Child component rendered')
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me!</button>
}

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('Button clicked');
  , []});  // Empty dependency array -> function is memoized

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <Child onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

**🔍 Without `useCallback`,** the `handleClick` function would be re-created on every render, causing unnecessary re-renders of the `Child` component.

## 🚀 `useMemo` vs `useCallback`: The Key Difference

| Hook          | Purpose                           | Returns                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `useMemo`     | Memoizes a **computed value**     | The computed **value**  |
| `useCallback` | Memoizes a **function reference** | The **function** itself |

## 🎯 When NOT to Use Them

❌ **Don't use `useMemo` or `useCallback` everywhere!** Unnecessary usage can make code harder to read and even reduce performance.

- **Avoid premature optimization**: If you don’t have performance issues, don't use them.
- **Don't use `useMemo` for simple values** (like numbers, booleans, or strings).
- **Don't use `useCallback` unless passing functions to memoized components**.

---

## 🎉 Wrapping Up

`useMemo` and `useCallback` are great for optimizing performance, but **use them wisely**! 🚀

- ✅ Use `useMemo` to memoize expensive calculations.
- ✅ Use `useCallback` to memoize function references.
- ⚠️ Don't overuse them—only optimize when needed!
